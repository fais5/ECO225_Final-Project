    "This research project aims to use records of the average land temperatures around the world categorized globally, by country, and by city to investigate whether climate change and global warming are supported by data. There will also be a focus on warming effect of different milestones in the development of transportation technology. Essentially, this research will look at how the rate of the rise of land temperatures has generally changed over since 1750 and how it changed immediately following the widespread use of new transportation technologies. The key is to examine how this rate is different in the period preceding the adoption of a certain new mode of transportation and immediately after it. The two primary events that will be isolated are the widespread use of the car (it was patented in 1886) and, subsequently, the aircraft (began to be used commercially in 1914)."

Some subsets of the data contain the monthly land temperature values categorized according to the country, city, major city, and US state. It's important to consider that this data begins around the same time that the Industrial Revolution is thought to have started. This is generally considered as the time that industrial pollution began to have seriously adverse effects on the climate and the temperature of the Earth. The outcome that is being considered in this research is the change in the average land temperature and the two main independent variables are pollution generally (which is essentially represented by time), the adoption of new transportation technologies, and the distance of each major city from the equator."

    "This research project aims to use records of the average land temperatures around the world categorized globally, by country, and by city to investigate whether climate change and global warming are supported by data. Additional data that will be used is global Co2 emissions data and per capita co2 emissions categorized by country. There will also be a focus on the warming effect of Co2 emissions which translates to pollution. Essentially, this research will look at how the rate of the rise of land temperatures has generally changed since 1750 and if these changes correspond to changes in the emission of Co2. Also, this report will examine if the rate of warming is different in different cities as well as if the oceans are warming faster than land."

    "The data that will be used is sourced from Berkeley Earth, an agency that has made several archives of environmental data avialable. The data contains monthly land temperature recordings that begin in 1750. After the year 1850, the data started included maximum and minimum values for each month. Some subsets of the data contain the monthly land temperature values categorized according to the country, city, major city, and US state. It's important to consider that this data begins around the same time that the Industrial Revolution is thought to have started. This is generally considered as the time that industrial pollution began to have seriously adverse effects on the climate and the temperature of the Earth. The additional data, Co2 emissions, is sourced from World Bank. This data will corespond to the level of pollution around the world. The dataset includes Co2 emissions categorized by country including a subset that contains cumulative global Co2 emissions. The outcome that is being considered in this research is the change in the average land temperature and the two main independent variables are pollution generally (which is essentially represented by Co2 emissions) and location. The per capita co2 emissions data will be sourced from the Wikipedia article titled, \"List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita\" and will be scraped."

    "Thus far, the different visual representations have been helpful at answering separate parts of the research question. This portion of the project aims to consolidate all the data collected and all the visual representations presented to provide a clear answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, it is clear that data about the average land temperature throughout history does in fact support claims about global warming. In the histogram titled \"Pct Change in Global Land Temp since 1750\", we can observe that although it seems like there are more instances where the global average temperature is decreasing, the skew in the plot demonstrates that there are more extreme changes in the temperature in the positive direction than the negative. Also, the maps presented show a slight change in the shades of the countries towards darker hues and although the differences are subtle, they have substantial implications with regards to the future of our planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the relationship between increases in Co2 emissions and the temperature of the Earth is practically undeniable. The graph titled \"Annual avg land temp vs. Co2 emissions\" shows the positive relationship between the increasing average global land temperature and the increasing level of co2 emissions. However the scraped data, which shows the 2015 per capita c02 emissions per country, shows us that the per capita measure of emissions is not a very good indicator of a country's contribution to general global warming. After finding the change in temperature for each country between 2010 and 2000 and then plotting that difference against the per capita emissions in 2015, there is no clear relationship. The visual representation corresponding to this claim is titled, \"Change in temp vs per capita c02 emissions\". This is likely due to large, populous countries which are very indsutrious having relatively low per capita emissions despite large changes in their land temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the final part of the questions asks whether some parts of the world are warming faster than others. The data demonstrates that the oceans are not warming at a rate that is faster than land. The graph titled, \"Land temp vs. land and ocean temp\" shows that there is an extremely strong linear relationship between the temperature of the land and the combined temperature of the land and oceans which signals that the two measures grow linearily. As for cities further away from the equator, the graph, \"Diff in city and global temp vs dist from equator\" shows that countries further away from the equator have a temperature that varies from the global average with the relationship seemingly having quadratic tendencies. That is, as countries get further away, the difference between the local and global temperature grows faster than the distance grows."

Also, part of my question is whether or not Co2 emissions are associated with an increasing global land temperature. My findings, which are demonstrated in the visualizations, support the claim that the Earth is steadily warming. The strongest evidence in favor of this hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between Co2 emissions and the temperature of the Earth. However, there is no evidence that distance from the equator or per capita co2 emissions are strong indicators for global warming. Despite this, there is conclusive evidence to assert that global warming is in fact a reality that we are facing and that co2 emissions are strongly related to this reality\n"

Global warming is a serious problem and this data supports its existence. It is difficult to doubt the effect that pollution has on our environment after considering these visualizations."

Additional data that will be used is global CO2 emissions data and per capita CO2 emissions categorized by country. There will also be a focus on the warming effect of CO2 emissions which translates to pollution. Essentially, this research will look at how the rate of the rise of land temperatures has generally changed since 1750 and if these changes correspond to changes in the emission of CO2. Also, this report will examine if the rate of warming is different in different cities as well as if the oceans are warming faster than land."

The data contains monthly land temperature recordings that begin in 1750. After the year 1850, the data started included maximum and minimum values for each month. Some subsets of the data contain the monthly land temperature values categorized according to the country, city, major city, and US state. It's important to consider that this data begins around the same time that the Industrial Revolution is thought to have started. This is generally considered as the time that industrial pollution began to have seriously adverse effects on the climate and the temperature of the Earth. The additional data, CO2 emissions, is sourced from World Bank. This data will corespond to the level of pollution around the world. The dataset includes CO2 emissions categorized by country including a subset that contains cumulative global CO2 emissions. The outcome that is being considered in this research is the change in the average land temperature and the two main independent variables are pollution generally (which is essentially represented by CO2 emissions) and location. The per capita CO2 emissions data will be sourced from the Wikipedia article titled, \"List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita\" and will be scraped."

    "This regression is important with respect to the general report since it highlights that the land on Earth is warming at the same rate as the oceans. This could mean that pollution which leads to higher land tempertaures has a similar effect on the oceans. This shows that our destructive habits are not only negatively influencing land masses, but also oceans; a part of the globe whose changes in temperature may not be immeditaely obvious."

    "Thus far, the different visual representations have been helpful at answering separate parts of the research question. This portion of the project aims to consolidate all the data collected and all the visual representations presented to provide a clear answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, it is clear that data about the average land temperature throughout history does in fact support claims about global warming. In the histogram titled \"Pct Change in Global Land Temp since 1750\", we can observe that although it seems like there are more instances where the global average temperature is decreasing, the skew in the plot demonstrates that there are more extreme changes in the temperature in the positive direction than the negative. Also, the maps presented show a slight change in the shades of the countries towards darker hues and although the differences are subtle, they have substantial implications with regards to the future of our planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the relationship between increases in CO2 emissions and the temperature of the Earth is practically undeniable. The graph titled \"Annual avg land temp vs. CO2 emissions\" shows the positive relationship between the increasing average global land temperature and the increasing level of CO2 emissions. However the scraped data, which shows the 2015 per capita c02 emissions per country, shows us that the per capita measure of emissions is not a very good indicator of a country's contribution to general global warming. After finding the change in temperature for each country between 2010 and 2000 and then plotting that difference against the per capita emissions in 2015, there is no clear relationship. The visual representation corresponding to this claim is titled, \"Change in temp vs per capita CO2 emissions\". This is likely due to large, populous countries which are very indsutrious having relatively low per capita emissions despite large changes in their land temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the final part of the questions asks whether some parts of the world are warming faster than others. The data demonstrates that the oceans are not warming at a rate that is faster than land. The graph titled, \"Land temp vs. land and ocean temp\" shows that there is an extremely strong linear relationship between the temperature of the land and the combined temperature of the land and oceans which signals that the two measures grow linearily. As for cities further away from the equator, the graph, \"Diff in city and global temp vs dist from equator\" shows that countries further away from the equator have a temperature that varies from the global average with the relationship seemingly having quadratic tendencies. That is, as countries get further away, the difference between the local and global temperature grows faster than the distance grows."

    "To conclude, the question I am trying to answer is if data about the temperature of the Earth supports the claim that there is global warming. Also, part of my question is whether or not CO2 emissions are associated with an increasing global land temperature. My findings, which are demonstrated in the visualizations, support the claim that the Earth is steadily warming. The strongest evidence in favor of this hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between CO2 emissions and the temperature of the Earth. However, there is no evidence that distance from the equator or per capita CO2 emissions are strong indicators for global warming. Despite this, there is conclusive evidence to assert that global warming is in fact a reality that we are facing and that CO2 emissions are strongly related to this reality\n"

    "My maps also support this hypothesis, although the differences in the shades of each country are slight the fact that there is a difference is significant. It is widely accepted that even slight changes in the temperature of the Earth have catastrophic events on the environment and warrants that there is an overhaul in the way we live life. Global warming is a serious problem and this data supports its existence. It is difficult to doubt the effect that pollution has on our environment after considering these visualizations."
